This entire program is essentially used to help you get the highest score possible for a mini game in a video game called final fantasy 14
The game consists of a 3x3 grid where initially you are revealed 1 digit
You are able to reveal 3 more digits
A line is a row,column or diagonal
A line consists of 3 digits, the sum of these digits is equal to a specific score
You can pick 1 line to get a score
A line can consits of unknown digits
My program tells the user where they should reveal their next digit based on average values.
Once they have revealed the maximum amount of digits, my program will tell the user which "line" will give them the highest score
This proposed "line" can consist of unknowns. This is because on average you will receive a higher score than a known line.
