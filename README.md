A LINE of DIGITS is equal to a sum and that sum is awarded a certain amount of points

A line is a row,column or diagonal

You can pick 1 line to get a score 

You can pick a line with unknown digits which will be revealed on locking in your choice

## Purpose of program

The purpose of the program is to, ON AVERAGE, get you the highest score possible on the minigame so that you can consistently get higher scores to improve your rewards

Currently the program does not have any GUI, HOWEVER, i may add this in the future
