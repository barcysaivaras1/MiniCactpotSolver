Project contains two users, both are me, Personal and Student accounts;

This is a personal project that i have decided to work on to practice my Test Driven Development Skills

The game consists of a 3x3 grid where initially you are revealed 1 digit

You are able to reveal 3 more digits

This is what the grid looks like when it is first opened

A LINE of DIGITS is equal to a sum and that sum is awarded a certain amount of points

A line is a row,column or diagonal

You can pick 1 line to get a score 

You can pick a line with unknown digits which will be revealed on locking in your choice

## Purpose of program

The purpose of the program is to, ON AVERAGE, get you the highest score possible on the minigame so that you can consistently get higher scores to improve your rewards

Currently the program does not have any GUI, HOWEVER, i may add this in the future

## Instructions on how to use it

Run the CactpotDriver using an IDE or Java

When you run the code you will be given a text based interface

You press 1 to input the grid that you are currently shown

You press 3 for it to calculate what your next best move would be

You reveal the tile that the program tells you

You then need to press 1 again and input the new grid that you have now.

You repeat the process until you have all reveals. On your final reveal, when you press 3, the program will tell you which line to choose

You are welcome to explore the other options to get more details
